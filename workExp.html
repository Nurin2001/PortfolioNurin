                    <p>
                        During my internship, one of my key responsibilities was migrating 16 projects from .NET 
                        Framework 4.7.2 to .NET Standard 2.0, which was no small task. Ensuring every project maintained 
                        its functionality and performance was a challenge I embraced, as I also converted 10 projects to 
                        fit Exact's new system design. 
                    <p>
                        Along the way, I contributed to resolving a few customer-reported 
                        bugs, which not only improved the deliverables but also helped streamline our team's efficiency. 
                        Being part of a dynamic scrum team of seven members, I immersed myself in Agile ceremonies, 
                        using Azure DevOps to keep tasks on track and ensure continuous integration flowed smoothly.

                    <p>
                        One of the most rewarding aspects of my work was collaborating with our Product Owner from the Netherlands, 
                        where I learned the importance of clear communication and attention to detail to meet <em>exacting</em> user 
                        story requirements and deliver them on time.
