Hi. This is actually my first time creating and designing my own website..
For now I'm still re-learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Why re-lrearning? Because actually I already learn them during my second year degree :')
but the class was too 'fun' I couldn't focus at all and at that time I didnt find web development fun..
I found it..difficult and troublesome..
But after my internship, I find it enjoyable.. surprisingly..
So, here goes my process of building my own online portfolio (with the help of ChatGpt) :)
